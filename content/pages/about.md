Hello! I am Shrikant Sharat Kandula, a Programmer and student Actuary, from India.

## What's powering it?

This static website was generated by a custom configuration of [Pelican][]. All source material has been created, edited and cursed at with the [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) editor.

## What's in here?

Dragons. Obviously.

On occasion, you'll also find short articles on experiences and experiments that I did with software
and programming. There'll also be some *long* articles on specific topics, mostly focused around
Python for now, but I intend to do such articles with Javascript and Bash as well in the future.

## How can you help?

Writing quality content and maintaining a website/blog takes a lot of time and effort. I currently
spend 15-20 hours per week in addition to my day-job for content on this website. If you like what
I'm doing and would like to support my work, please consider the following options.

This website is rumored to contain stuff that's not entirely unlike garbage from outer space that
would jump out of your device unless you know where your towel is.
