## Httpbun ![Icon](https://httpbun.com/assets/icon-32.png)

[httpbun.com](https://httpbun.com) [httpbun.org](https://httpbun.org) [Source Code](https://github.com/sharat87/httpbun) {github-stars httpbun}
{ .links }

This is an HTTP service with endpoints that are useful when testing any HTTP client, like a browser, a library, or any API developer tool. It's heavily inspired by [httpbin](https://httpbin.org).

## Just a calendar

[justacalendar.app](https://justacalendar.app/) {github-stars just-a-calendar}
{ .links }

An easily reachable endpoint to have a calendar to look at. No signup, no setup, no downloads, no flash and very little features. Perfect when you want to show a calendar and talk about dates when sharing your screen in a presentation or meeting.

- Mark dates with four different colors.
- Marked dates are saved in your browser's local storage, so they survive restarts.
- Right click on a date to quickly copy the date in several useful formats.
- Dark mode, for the rest of you guys.
- Hotkeys for common actions. Hit <kbd>?</kbd> for quick help.
- Remove all marks with a single click.

Considered a "finished" project, and I'm using it every day.

## Prestige

[prestige.dev](https://prestige.dev) [Source Code](https://github.com/sharat87/prestige) {github-stars prestige}
{ .links }

A text-based HTTP client in the browser. An interface-less Postman. It supports a powerful grammar with embedded JavaScript for templating requests, doing environments, asserting responses and any other fancy.

Frontend is a [Mithril.js](https://mithril.js.org/) project, and backend is a [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com)  project.

Not in active development, but I still love the idea and wish I can come back to it one day. ðŸ˜ƒ

## LittleTools

[littletools.app](https://littletools.app) {github-stars littletools}
{ .links }

A suite of little power tools for developers and powers users. Very hobby project.

## Antigen

[Project Page](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen) {github-stars zsh-users/antigen}
{ .links }

A plugin manager for zsh, inspired by oh-my-zsh and vundle. This is one of the first of it's kind and has inspired many alternative plugin managers for zsh as well as other popular shells.

This is currently being maintained by the community, the zsh-users organizations on Github.
