Hello! I am Shrikant Sharat Kandula, a Programmer and student Actuary, from India.

All content written by me, unless otherwise specified, are licensed with Creative Commons
Attribution (CC BY) license. If you would like to reuse large parts of the content on this website,
please [get in touch](/contact/).

This static website was generated by a custom static site generator written in Python and rendered
with Jinja2 templates. None of the existing static site generators provided what I wanted without a
lot of customization. The effort to configure and customize them was about the same as building
something that worked *just* for me, *just* right.

## Support

Writing quality content and maintaining a website/blog takes a lot of time and effort. I currently
spend 15-20 hours per week in addition to my day-job for content on this website. If you like what
I'm doing and would like to support my work, please consider the following options.

## Warning

This website is rumored to contain stuff that's not entirely unlike garbage from outer space that
would jump out of your device unless you know where your towel is.
