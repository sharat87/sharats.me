This is a list of my public projects and experiments. You can follow me on Github for updates on my
current work and future experiments.

## ThreaDance

*Oct 2017* &middot; [*Project Page*](https://github.com/sharat87/tda)

A Java thread dump analyser that works entirely in the browser. I built this to help analysing
thread dumps taken at regular intervals and finding the root causes for performance problems in Java
applications. It handles dumps with ~800 threads per dump gracefully but starts to slightly lag
after that.

Developed using the Vue.js library.

## Antigen

*May 2012* &middot; [*Project Page*](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen)

A plugin manager for zsh, inspired by oh-my-zsh and vundle. This is one of the first of it's kind
and has inspired many alternative plugin managers for zsh as well as other popular shells.

This is currently being maintained by the community, the zsh-users organizations on Github.

[zsh-vim-mode](http://github.com/sharat87/zsh-vim-mode)
