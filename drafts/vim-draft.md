title: Automating the ViM workplace

I majorly use two tools for my coding workflow and one of them is GViM (on Windows). It's my primary
choice for editing text for ten years now and in that time, I've picked up several habits and tricks
that made me very productive. I'm hoping to do several articles in the coming weeks to share some of
these.

[TOC]

## Motivation

Most of my text editing involves working with Python, Markdown,
and JavaScript source files. When I'm spending as much time as I am with ViM, it ceases to be just a
tool in my mind. It becomes a state of mind where I'm able to translate my thoughts into actions much
faster than it/I can do with something else. It becomes my workplace.

Just like organizing one's desk or toolbox for maximum efficiency, treating ViM this way can help us
do something similar with our ViM. For that reason, I try to notice things that I do often, that
take more than 3-4 seconds of thought and then a few more seconds of hitting hotkeys or commands.
These are the ones I try to create a command or a hotkey. In my world, this is borderline
automation.

Note that what I'm sharing here is stuff I created/scavenged from years out of identifying patterns
*very specific* to my work style. My goal is not to share nice tidbits of ViM configuration. It is
to encourage you to identify your work style and work towards optimising it, before you go find a
plugin and *learn* the plugin's work style. Your own style of working deserves the first chance, and
not just in ViM.

Please note that all that I share below is what I'm using with ViM. I don't use NeoVim (yet) and I
can't speak for any of the below for NeoVim.
